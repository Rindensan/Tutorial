                    <p id="ctoppara">Noel is the definition of the “shrinking violet” archetype. She is shy, clumsy, and tends to get worked up over the smallest things. Noel is extremely self-conscious, especially regarding her notoriously flat breasts. She can be socially awkward at times, but this has actually served as an endearing trait, which earned her Tsubaki and Makoto’s friendship. In spite of this, she is shown to be quite passionate and determined when motivated, and is loyal to her friends and allies.</p>
